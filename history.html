				<p>It was in the 1950&apos;s that the link between computers and human-like intelligence
				was first observed. One of the men to first notice this link was called Norbert Weiner.
				He created the &quot;feedback theory&quot;. With this theory he was able to see that all
				intelligent machines provided feedback mechanisms. For example, the thermostat
				must be able to control a temperature of the environment by collecting data from the
				actual temperature of the room, allowing a response from the thermostat to either turn
				the heat up or down. This is what he called feedback response. As well as this, in 1995,
				Wiener and his partner produced a crucial theory that presented all problems in a
				tree-like structure as it followed the branch that was most likely to result in the
				correct solution. This was called &quot;The logic theorist&quot; and is still used in many modern
				AI systems.</p>
				<p>1957-1958: As Weiner continued to create programs, such as the General Problem
				Solver (GPS), John McCarthy, the man who coined the name &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;,
				worked on what became a major breakthrough in the field of AI as he created a 
				programming language called &quot;LISP&quot; (LISt Processing), which has become the programming
				language of choice for AI projects and programmers.</p>
				<p>Artificial Intelligence became such a high interest to the U.S government that they
				granted $2.2 million into the field, with hopes to stay ahead of the Soviet Union in 
				their advancements within artificial intelligence.</p>
				<p>In the 1970&apos;s, AI developers achieved the creation of an expert system. These machines 
				are important due to their ability to store a lot of information and conditions for rules,
				which allowed them to help in the medical field by diagnosing patients in place of a 
				doctor.</p>
				<p>Funds continued to be pumped into the field of artificial intelligence, encouraging
				researchers from around the globe to take interest and contribute to the development of
				AI.</p>
				<p>However, in the 1980&apos;s, the interest in AI began to drop, which caused investments
				to stop and the industry overall lost almost half a billion dollars. Despite this,
				Japan persevered and continued to develop new technology and programs within AI as they
				looked into machines that were able to make decisions based on a set number of conditions
				as well as reconsidering the use of neural networks within the field. They believed that
				the research would reach some form of significance by the 21st century.</p>
				<p>Again, the interest of Artificial Intelligence is at its peak. It is at the stage
				where the advancements in technology have become of growing interest to the public
				through use of voice and character recognition software that has become a part of 
				everyday life. AI is used within many fields; including the military as they begin
				to use AI based hardware, in robotics, in gaming, in medicine and is also used in space
				exploration and research.</p>

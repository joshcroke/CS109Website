				<p>Evolutionary computation is a fundamental element of AI which focuses on finding the
				optimal solution for a problem that is either provided by the user of by a computer.
				This process is based around the subject of biology and takes a lot of the techniques
				involved with evolution (such as natural selection) and applies them to computational
				problems.</p>
				<p>Evolutionary computation can be broken down into many different types of algorithms
				and forms of programming. The main areas in which it can be split up into are as follows:
				<UL>
					<LI>Evolutionary Algorithms</LI>
					<LI>Evolutionary Programming</LI>
					<LI>Genetic Algorithms</LI>
					<LI>Genetic Programming</LI>
					<LI>Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithms</LI>
				</UL></p>
				<p>Many of these areas are related or are subsets of the same technique but all are 
				different techniques on how to reach a solution via computation.</p>
				<p>Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (MOA) are one of the fundamental techniques
				used in other forms of evolutionary computation. This is simply the process of trying
				to optimize the solution to a problem by finding the minimum and maximum to the range 
				of all the possible solutions to the problem, or in other words the search space of the
				problem. This technique is used for global optimization rather than for a specific task
				or element of a solution, although it is not always successful and due to the nature of 
				the processes involved it is not guaranteed to be efficient.</p>
				<p>There are two major components to MOA; intensification and diversification. These are 
				two separate processes involved in the optimization process. Intensification means to 
				focus the search for the correct solution in a small region as it knows the solution is
				in this local area. Diversification is generating random and diverse solutions so as to 
				explore the entirety of the search space. A good balance between these two elements 
				ensures that the algorithm maintain its overall efficiency and that global optimization
				is achievable.</p>
				<p> Many of the processes involved in Genetic programming and Evolutionary programming 
				are based around genetic algorithms, and although this is more of the biological side of
				these techniques, it forms the basis of techniques which are fundamental in artificial 
				intelligence.</p>
				<p>Genetic algorithms are based around the process of natural selection and similarly
				evolutionary techniques which are found in nature. In computer science and artificial 
				intelligence the genetic algorithms mimic this natural selection and evolutionary 
				techniques.</P>
				<p>It is classed as a meta-heuristic (also called a heuristic) type of algorithm which
				is another method of generating useful solutions to search and optimization problems.
				This is achieved by using techniques such as inheritance, mutation, selection and 
				crossover.</p>
				<p> It starts off with a selection of initial solutions and steadily evolves these
				solutions through the evolutionary techniques mentioned above. Each solution has
				section (chromosomes or genotype) which can be changed, or mutated, to work towards
				the optimal solution. These solutions are typically represented in binary but other
				encoding is possible. In each generation or stage of evolution the function is evaluated
				by its &apos;fitness.&apos; The fitness is how optimal the solution is too the problem 
				(based on the time taken to find a solution). Once each potential solution has been
				evaluated, the fittest solutions are evolved to the next level and then process starts
				over.</p>
				<p>A typical genetic algorithm needs a representation of the domain or search space
				in which it is too look for the solution and also a fitness function to evaluate how 
				effective each generation or stage is.</p>
				<p>The algorithm is terminated when search criteria is met. There are a number of ways
				in which this criteria can be met, some commons ways of the algorithm terminating are
				that; the solution matches the minimum criteria set on initialisation, the fixed number 
				of times the potential solutions were evolved is reached, the allocated computation time
				is reached and that the highest ranking solution's fitness is good enough that it cannot
				be improved any further.</p>
				<p>The genetic algorithm does have its limitations though. It struggles to find optimal
				solutions to a complex problem within a finite time as the search space is too large.
				Also if a problem generates an exponential increase in the search space then it can take
				a huge amount of time to come up with a solution which may not even be particularly 
				efficient.</p>
				<p>Genetic programming is the computation equivalent of genetic algorithms. It uses the
				same process, techniques and ideas but in a computer environment. The purpose of genetic
				programming is to evaluate how efficient a computer program is at solving a problem.
				It is also used to optimize the program by using the genetic algorithm techniques such as
				crossover and mutation. Crossover is applied to a potential solution (or computer program)
				and means switching an element of the program with another individual. The mutation
				technique replaces an element rather than switching it. The process of optimization is
				exactly the same as the genetic algorithm in that a solution (computer program) is 
				evolved, it&apos;s fitness evaluated and then the highest ranking solution is evolved again
				until the most efficient solution is found.</p>
				<p>Evolutionary programming is one of the four major evolutionary algorithm concepts.
				Its similar to genetic programming but the structure of the program is fixed and only 
				its numerical values are allowed to evolve. Its main operator is mutation.</p>
				<p>These different types of algorithms and programming are used in modern Artificial
				intelligence systems to help choose the correct solutions to problems. The techniques
				have been adapted and changed over the years but are still based off of the fundamentals
				of evolution and mainly mimic the process of natural selection but in terms of computation.

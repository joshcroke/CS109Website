			<BODY><M1>
				<p>The military and warfare has been the main driving force for technological 
				advancements in artificial intelligence for many years, making use of the algorithms
				developed in this field. The first computer was built with military funding in order to
				decode enemy signals and calculate missile trajectories. To date the military is largely 
				driven by AI and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
				<p>The applications of AI in the military are vast. Alan Turing was the first to use 
				computers to break the Germans Enigma code during the war. AI went on to be used to 
				simulate nuclear escalations and how the arms races would be effect by different
				boundaries. Nowadays AI is used in the military to process enormous amounts of data 
				such as videos, intelligence and signals. AI is essential, the data needs to be analysed
				as fast as possible, as there could be lives in the balance. An example of this would be
				video footage in which the AI would be able to decipher what was taking place, and if
				there was anything threatening or of importance, report the information back to 
				headquarters.</p>
				<p>Another major application of AI in the military can be found in unmanned vehicles
				and aircraft. These are often controlled remotely but can also be autonomous and 
				self-directing. This allows them to be smaller, meaning they can reach difficult areas,
				which would otherwise be inaccessible. Having an unmanned vehicle also has the benefit 
				of removing any threat to human life.</p>
				<p>Another field in which AI is improving the military is in the air force. They are 
				looking into being able to collect and analyse data at incredible speeds in order to
				improve decision making and reaction times. Voice recognition is also always being 
				developed for pilots as it allows them to control and manage the aircraft more easily,
				improving efficiency and reducing the chance of pilot error causing crashes.</p>
				<p>Although AI has been in the military for many years and continues to become a 
				prominent part of its strategy, there are still some ethical issues to be addressed.
				One being that some people may question the reliability of non-human combatants.
				There may be an error in the machine, or it could wrongly distinguish between ally 
				and enemy. If something were to go wrong it be catastrophic and lead to many questions
				of using AI over human combatants. Another issue raised is that computers may completely
				replace any decision making made in the military, only needing to be monitored. Lastly,
				there is concern over the ability of an AI run combatant to be able to choose the correct
				amount of force for the unique situation.</p>
				<p>AI has a vast array of applications within the military, and is advancing constantly.
				As techniques improve and become more reliable there will be an even larger influx of AI
				on the battlefield. It will be a leading factor in nearly all decision making in the 
				future.</p>

				<p>Expert systems are one of the most useful applications of Artificial intelligence as
				they can be used in place of a human expert. They do this by mimicking the human decision
				making process and coming to an informed decision.  These were actually one of the first
				successful pieces of artificial intelligence software to be created.</p>
				<p>One of the major expert systems used in the modern day is to help diagnose patients.
				For example, Pathfinder is an expert system that helps surgical pathologists with the 
				diagnosis of lymph-node diseases, which could potentially save lives.  There are also 
				expert systems that can find solutions to complicated mathematical problems which would 
				save people a lot of time and effort.</p>
				<p>There are many differences between expert systems and traditional computer programs. 
				The main way in which they differ is the way that the problem knowledge is used and the
				way that it is stored for the system to use it.</p>
				<p>Expert systems can bring a variety of benefits to an organisation, especially if the
				organisation relies on having people who specialize in different fields. If a doctor is
				relying on an expert, in a specific field, to diagnose a patient then it could take a
				very long time to get a consultation arranged and reach a decision on the diagnosis. 
				However, with the use of an expert system, this process can be made a lot easier and
				quicker as the system can search through its database for similar symptoms that the 
				patient is experiencing. It could also pick up on a rarer disease that even some experts
				may not be familiar with.</p>
				<p>There are many different types of organisations and businesses that make use of expert
				systems in order to make life easier for themselves. For example, the banking, 
				telecommunications and investments industries all use expert systems to help them run 
				their businesses. Expert systems are also vital in robotics and natural language 
				processing, as well as proving theorems. These systems have also been used to help
				control and monitor traffic which benefits society as it means a human is not needed to
				do this job as the expert system can do it instead.</p>

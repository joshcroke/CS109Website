				<p>Artificial intelligence is a very controversial subject as many people argue that
				because as robots become more intelligent, are they actually &apos;alive&apos;. The famous computer
				scientist and mathematician Alan Turing asked if machines could think in his 1950 seminal
				paper. If these machines are in fact alive then they should have their own rights which
				are similar to human or animal rights. These rights will supposedly be put in place in the
				next 50 years, when machines become sophisticated to require these rights. These could 
				include the right to life and freedom of thought or expression, as well as seen as equal
				by law. These robots could even have voting rights, serving in military and will have to
				pay taxes.</p>
				<p>One of the issues is that the public&apos;s opinion is split between whether they either think
				that it is a great tool to be used or to be afraid of it. Some people believe that one
				day humans could be replaced by artificial intelligence, as robots could perform the same
				job but quicker, more efficient and cheaper. Another issue is trust, as machines are 
				learning how to diagnose and access patients&apos; medical records. This also means that
				privacy and security rights are broken as these robots will have access the internet in 
				order to complete their diagnosis. Robots that can recognise speech and other functions 
				will also be able to listen to what people are saying, and people theorise that this 
				type of program could be used by governments to monitor phone conversations and email 
				messages.</p>
				<p>It is a fear of robotics taking over our lives as prosthetic limbs can become stronger
				and faster than human counterparts and thoughts of implants to improve brain function have
				people afraid of losing their humanity and will.</p>
				<p>A lot of people also agree that AI should not be used to replace people with roles
				in care, such as therapists, police officers and nurses. If machines replace these 
				people, it could alienate humans as these roles require empathy and feelings, whereas a
				robot might not be able to express these emotions naturally.</p>
				<p>The main issues with artificial intelligence are whether or not robots can think for
				themselves, the fear of the unknown, willingness of humans to comply with robots and the
				rights that robots could potentially have. It is not known how much of the human mind we
				can recreate using robots, but it certainly looks like the next 50 years could mean that
				we will be seeing more of AI on a day to day basis.</p>
				<p>In conclusion AI is a very promising aspect of technology within our society. It can
				help the general public in terms of expert systems which can diagnosis patients or assist
				people with disabilities to drive cars with the assistance of an artificial intelligence
				system. The applications of artificial intelligence in our modern day society could have
				endless benefits to the general public as well as in other areas such as the military to
				help prevent the loss of human life. Overall in the next 50 years artificial intelligence
				will become a larger and more accepted part of every person&apos;s life as developments in the
				technology continue to improve artificial intelligence.</p>

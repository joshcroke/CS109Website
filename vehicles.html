				<p>Artificial intelligence is being used more and more in today&apos;s society. One of the
				main things that artificial intelligence is continuously helping to improve is vehicles.
				The future of transportation will be majorly shaped by artificial intelligence. 
				Autonomous vehicles are most likely going to be a huge part of our future and will bring
				many benefits to our society. As this technology continues to improve these vehicles
				will keep getting better and more efficient bringing even more benefits to people and 
				the overall business.</p>
				<p>Autonomous vehicles have massive potential to improve the safety of pedestrians, 
				through the use of artificial intelligence and advances in crash avoidance technology.
				According to Government Estimates, as many as 90% of car accidents are caused by human
				error rather than faults with the vehicles. However, new technologies will help reduce 
				this figure as humans will not have to think as much about safe driving because the 
				technology will play a bigger role in driving and do most of the work for them. Recently,
				the Eno Centre for Transportation released a paper projecting that if 10 percent of all
				vehicles in the United States were self-driving, the number of accidents each year would
				be cut by 211,000, and 1,100 lives would be saved. Also if the share of self-driving
				vehicles increased to 90 percent, as many as 4.2 million accidents could be avoided,
				saving an estimated total of 21,700 lives each year. This is an incredible breakthrough
				in technology as it could actually save lives and make society a lot safer for both 
				drivers and pedestrians.</p>
				<p>There are also lots of other benefits that would come with the introduction of
				self-driving cars. For example, autonomous vehicles could help to reduce our carbon
				footprint. According to a McKinsey research study authored this year, 300 million tons 
				of carbon dioxide emissions could be saved annually with the introduction of autonomous
				vehicles. This would be advantageous to society as it would help protect the environment
				and prevent such things as global warming. These vehicles could also help reduce 
				congestion in cities and therefore save people time when they are travelling as the 
				technology would allow the traffic to flow efficiently and avoid traffic jams as the cars
				would all be moving at a consistent speed.</p>
				<p>This advanced technology would allow people with physical disabilities to operate 
				vehicles safely as the technology would substitute some of the human involvement in 
				driving. This would mean that driving would be easier for a lot of people who are 
				currently unable to drive as the technology can assist and potentially takeover control 
				if needed.</p>
				<p>There would also be huge financial saving with the introduction of these autonomous
				vehicles. Morgan Stanley estimated that these vehicles would &quot;contribute $1.3 trillion
				in annual savings to the U.S. economy alone, with global savings estimated at over $5.6
				trillion&quot;. This would clearly be a benefit to our society and to the economy overall.</p>
				<p>The self-driving car technology is already operating in some areas around the world,
				the state of Nevada in the US was the first state to approve of these cars and allow them
				on public roads. These cars use artificial intelligence software to guide them on the 
				highways and roads and analyze the situation for any potential hazards. Some features of 
				these cars include cameras on the front and rear of the car so that they can mimic the
				human eyesight and know when traffic lights change, and radar units mounted to the 
				bumpers. These self-driving cars can be identified by a red license plate containing a 
				special symbol.</p>
				<p>Some current standard cars actually already use various types of artificial 
				intelligence software, such as cars that have built in parking assistance or automatic
				lights that come on when it gets dark. It is almost certain that this software is going
				to improve until eventually all cars will be fully autonomous and the human involvement
				in driving will be minimal. It has been said that by 2020, these fully autonomous cars
				will be a reality.</p>

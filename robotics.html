				<p>One of the most practical uses of Artificial intelligence is within the robotics 
				industry, however it is also one of the most controversial areas as well. Robots have 
				been around for decades and have helped humans with daily tasks, production and more. 
				But nowadays robots are not programmed with a few simple set functions, but are beginning
				to become more conscious and able to make their own decisions. Scientists today are 
				trying to find new ways to produce better AI for robots and will hopefully be able to
				recreate the intelligence of a human by having a machine that has the intellectual 
				capabilities of a person. We are currently not at this level of artificial intelligence,
				but robots can replicate some parts of a human mind and make their own decisions based 
				upon this intelligence.</p>
				<p>One of the basic functions of an AI robot is that it can solve problems optimally.
				This is done through information gathering using sensors or with human input. The robot
				will then compare this information to data within itself and will decipher what the 
				information means, and run through various simulations of possible actions and decide
				which one would be the best. However if any information that is new or if the robot does 
				not have any data relating to the information, then the robot will not be able to come 
				to a decision and solve the problem.</p>
				<p>Many robots nowadays can learn from trial and error, or from humans showing the robot 
				how to complete a task or a set of movements. For example, a robot can find an obstacle
				in its path so it could try walking into the obstacle, which would achieve a negative
				outcome. The robot can then figure to move its legs to step over or move to the side and
				will be able to bypass the obstacle. The robot can then store this information within its
				data banks and use it when a similar situation arises. This is what the robot ASIMO can
				perform, in addition to it being one of the first robots to run to speeds of 6 kilometres
				per hour and recognise gestures such as a handshake.</p>
				<p>Newer robots also operate using a different structure which uses low level computers
				with low level actions instead of using a central computer for every action. This is 
				believed to be a more accurate depiction of human intelligence as we do not commit every
				action with the most thought.</p>
				<p>The main problem with artificial intelligence is that the brain is a complex organ 
				that contains billions of neurons and to attempt recreate it in a computer form seems 
				nearly impossible. Due to this, AI research is based on theories about how we learn and 
				think and then try to replicate them with robots. This can also help us understand how 
				our own minds work in general.</p>

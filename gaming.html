				<p>Another application of Artificial intelligence is in the gaming industry where it is
				used to create non-playing characters (NPC&apos;s) that behave with an aspect of intelligence.
				AI in gaming is far different from AI in other fields, their abilities need to be highly
				dampened in order to give the user a fair chance. An easy example of this can be seen in
				any first-person shooter. If the AI of the NPC were not toned down they would always be
				perfectly accurate, in which case a human would not be able to compete, as they could not
				achieve an equal skill level.</p>
				<p>One of the earliest examples of Ai in gaming can be found in Pong, which was developed,
				in the early 1970&apos;s followed by the huge success of Space Invaders later that decade.
				It was during this golden age of arcade games that AI opponents were popularised and
				led to further development in the technology. AI in games began to advance at an 
				astonishing rate, as consumers continually desired to see better, more realistic games 
				with a greater sense of realism and satisfaction.</p>
				<p>An example of a video game with highly acclaimed AI would be &apos;Creatures&apos;. This was an
				&apos;Artificial Life&apos; game series from 1997 to 2001. The game was well renowned for it&apos;s
				sophisticated evolutionary algorithm, which controlled the reproduction and birth of the
				game&apos;s central characters, &apos;Norns&apos;. Each Norn had a Neural Network which allowed them to
				adapt to their environment, driving their actions and learning from their mistakes.
				Neural networks are inspired by the mechanics of the human brain. It is composed of a
				large number of processing elements, which are interconnected, working together in order
				to solve a problem. Just like people these neural networks learn by example. This was
				seen as an enormous breakthrough in artificial life research.</p>
				<p>There were a multitude of milestones in the development of artificial intelligence
				found in games between 1990 and 2001. Firstly there was one of the more popular games
				from the 1990&apos;s, WarCraft. It was the first game to use path-finding algorithms on a 
				massive scale, to control hundreds of units. Another came from the game Black&amp;White,
				developed in 2001, in which technologies of computer-controlled character&apos;s learning
				were used for the first time.</p>
				<p>There are two main AI algorithms used most commonly in computer games. The first is
				an A-Star algorithm used to preform fast searches for the best possible route connecting 
				two different points within the game. The second is a finite state machine, which 
				regulates computer-controlled objects&apos; behaviour.</p>
				<p>The A* is a type of search algorithm.  A common problem in computer games is finding 
				a way from point A to B on a map. The algorithm carries out the process of plotting a 
				path between two points, called nodes, which can be traversable. It used a best-first
				search, in which it looks for the most cost efficient path from the given initial node 
				to the required final node. The algorithm can take into account many factors, such as
				terrain, number of enemies and other such elements that will vary from game to game.</p>
				<p>The second AI algorithm is the finite state machine (FSM). This is the algorithm most
				coders would turn to in order to give their game the impression of intelligence. 
				Each object in a game can be separated into different states to which each part has its
				own code. A common example of this is a knight who can be patrolling, arming himself, 
				attacking or resting. Its popularity comes from a multitude of benefits. The FSMs are
				easy to code and can be created quickly due to the simplicity of the code and the fact
				the different states have their own code, if there is an error within one of the game 
				object&apos;s behaviour, it can be traced and debugged efficiently. Lastly, the FSMs can easily
				be modified by the user to fit their needs, as it is a very flexible and intuitive
				algorithm.</p>
				<p>Although these two algorithms are the most commonly used, (at one stage A* accounted
				for 90% of game AI) new developments are always being created and old ones improved upon
				to generate new, superior game AI. It is an essential tool to improve the gaming 
				experience and will be a leading factor in game innovation in years to come.</p>
